# Java Challenges Repository

This repository contains a collection of Java coding challenges and exercises covering various fundamental concepts such as control flow, string manipulation, exception handling, and object-oriented programming.

## Projects

### 1. Cryptic Message Decoder
*   **Location:** [Chapter1_Challenge_1_1-master](./Chapter1_Challenge_1_1-master)
*   **Description:** A program that decodes a numeric message (`13579`) by extracting specific digits using math operations (modulus, division) to generate a final code based on products and sums.

### 2. Lottery Number Analyzer
*   **Location:** [Chapter1_Challenge_1_2-master](./Chapter1_Challenge_1_2-master)
*   **Description:** Analyzes a list of lottery ticket strings (e.g., "12-34-56..."). It parses the strings, calculates the average value of the digits for each ticket, and identifies the "winning" ticket with the highest average.

### 3. Dungeon Game
*   **Location:** [chapter1_challenge_1_3](./chapter1_challenge_1_3)
*   **Description:** A text-based adventure game where the player starts with 100 health and must survive 5 rooms. Random events include traps, healing potions, and monster battles requiring number guessing.

### 4. Robust File Config Reader
*   **Location:** [chapter1_challenge1_4](./chapter1_challenge1_4)
*   **Description:** Demonstrates robust exception handling in Java. It reads a `config.txt` file, validates a version number, checks for file existence based on a path in the config, and handles specific exceptions like `FileNotFoundException` and custom exceptions.

### 5. Chapter 2 Challenge Applet
*   **Location:** [Chapter2_Challenge_Applett-main](./Chapter2_Challenge_Applett-main)
*   **Description:** A skeleton project structure for a future challenge application.
